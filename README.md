Welcome to **My-SpringBoot-Playground**, a repository showcasing my hands-on practice with Spring Boot. This repo contains various mini-projects and APIs that I have developed to learn and explore different features and functionalities of Spring Boot.

Each project is an independent server with unique functionality, ranging from simple CRUD applications to more complex systems. These projects are intended to help me practice building real-world applications and improving my Spring Boot skills.

## Projects in this Repository

### 1. **Todo API** üìù (Project: [todowoo](https://github.com/ShyamSundhar1411/My-SpringBoot-Playground/tree/master/todowoo))
   - A simple Todo application to manage tasks with basic CRUD operations.
   - Features include task creation, updating, completion status, and deletion.

### 2. **Books API** üìö (Project: [bookwiz](https://github.com/ShyamSundhar1411/My-SpringBoot-Playground/tree/master/bookwiz))
   - An API to manage a book library.
   - Allows adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving book details, including title, author, and genre.
   - Features search functionality based on author, title, or genre.

### 3. **User Authentication System** üîê (Project: [accessa](https://github.com/ShyamSundhar1411/My-SpringBoot-Playground/tree/master/accessa))  
   -  A modular and secure user authentication system built with Spring Boot.  
   -  Supports user registration, login, JWT-based authentication, role-based access, and more.
   
### 4. **File Storage System with AWS** ‚òÅÔ∏èüóÑÔ∏è (Project: [arkive](https://github.com/ShyamSundhar1411/My-SpringBoot-Playground/tree/master/arkive))
   - A secure file storage system integrated with AWS S3 for file upload, download, and management.
   - Features include user authentication, file metadata management, and support for secure file operations (upload, download, and delete).

### 5. **Meldora** üéµüé¨ (Project: [meldora](https://github.com/ShyamSundhar1411/My-SpringBoot-Playground/tree/master/meldora))
- A unified entertainment aggregator backend built with Spring Boot and GraphQL.
- Integrates Spotify API for music data and TMDb (The Movie Database) API for movie data.
- Provides a single GraphQL API to fetch, search, and combine music and movie information.
- Supports user-specific favorites stored in a database to personalize content.
- Demonstrates modern API design using GraphQL to seamlessly combine multiple data sources.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** (Main framework)
- **Spring Data JPA** (For database interaction)
- **Spring Security** (For secure authentication in relevant projects)
- **H2 Database** (For local development and testing)
- **JWT** (For token-based authentication in user authentication projects)
- **GraphQL Java / Spring GraphQL** (For API layerS)
- **REST clients** (WebClient/RestTemplate) for external API integration

---

## Features and Enhancements

- All projects follow RESTful architecture or GraphQL API design, exposing APIs for CRUD and complex queries.
- Some projects include JWT-based authentication, pagination, filtering, and modular service layers.
- Aimed at demonstrating best practices for Spring Boot applications, including clean code, validation, API design, and external API integration.
