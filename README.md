Welcome to **My-SpringBoot-Playground**, a repository showcasing my hands-on practice with Spring Boot. This repo contains various mini-projects and APIs that I have developed to learn and explore different features and functionalities of Spring Boot.

Each project is an independent server with unique functionality, ranging from simple CRUD applications to more complex systems. These projects are intended to help me practice building real-world applications and improving my Spring Boot skills.

   - A simple Todo application to manage tasks with basic CRUD operations.
   - Features include task creation, updating, completion status, and deletion.

### 2. **Books API** üìö (Project: [bookwiz](https://github.com/ShyamSundhar1411/My-SpringBoot-Playground/tree/master/bookwiz))
   - An API to manage a book library.
   - Allows adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving book details, including title, author, and genre.
   - Features search functionality based on author, title, or genre.
